# bootstrap-easy-sidebar

I've seen a few sidebars for bootstrap around and found most of them lacking in the areas of theme integeration and flexibility.
This is an attempt at full integrating a sidebar with Bootstrap by inheriting all styling from navbar and then changing where required.

Should support any kind of bootstrap theme you throw at it, I've tested a few free ones from around the web to check compatibility.

Any issues don't hesitate to let me know
